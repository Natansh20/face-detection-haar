# face-detection-haar
A Haar feature-based cascade classifier is a machine learning-based approach that trains a cascade function on a large number of positive and negative images. Using an XML file, I trained it to detect faces. I used methods from libraries such as Matplotlib and OpenCV. Later, I modified it to detect faces in real time as well.
